            Hello, my name is Joan. I'm an incoming senior undergraduate at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The summer of 2018, I was supported by the Computing Research Association to explore research through their <a href="https://cra.org/cra-w/dreu/">DREU program</a>. This website features the work I've done during my experience.
