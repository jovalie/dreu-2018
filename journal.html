                I was notified this week that I am accepted to present a poster at Grace Hopper! I'm really excited. I presented a poster there last year on last summer's DREU project, to say the least it was a very eye-opening experience. Theres a lot of things I wish I had done/done better, so I'm really excited to have another opportunity to attend this event.

                I finally get to use PyDial. I created a script that downloads RxNorm files and creates SQLite databases that the ontology tool from PyDial can use. Or so I thought; the ontology tool that PyDial provides only works with databases that has one table in it. I have seven total. This could mean that I'll have to create my own ontology tool, which hopefully means that I can handle my database in a similar fashion to the existing ontology tool, modified slightly to deal with databases of several tables.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another issue I'm facing with PyDial is that it's completely written in Python 2. I was hoping to use Python 3 so I can use newer libraries in my code if need me, but it may be likely that I'll have to write my code with Python 2. There is a library (python-future) that allows Python 2 libraries to be compatible with Python 3 code, which I did try to use, but the way that PyDial handles importing modules seems to be incompatible with Python 3 code even after running it through python-future. I guess I can say that I've learned a lot about Python's import system this week.
            </p>

                This week somebody called me a "real computer programmer". Am I really a real computer programmer? I spend most of my time dealing with messy problems that I've created in my code (I wish my code was more elegant.) and reading documentation because I feel so new to everything! What makes a fake computer progammer? At what point does one transcend from being an "fake" to a "real" computer programmer?

            <h2>Friday, June 8, 2018</h2>

            <p>
                Hello! This is my second summer working with CRA's DREU program. Honestly, I'd say that last year was the zenith of my college experience (so far) by introducing me to research. I'm hoping that this summer is even better than the last... there's a lot of things that I want to accomplish.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                List of goals for the summer
                <ul>
                    <li>Start learning machine learning techniques and incorporate them into my work. This goal is far overdue for me.</li>
                    
                    <li>Become more comfortable digging into the theory behind the systems I'm working with. Last year I got caught up trying to get the systems I was working with to actually <em>work</em>, not so much paying attention to the algoritems behind the systems. It's understandable because everything was really new to me, but I want to have a stronger sense of direction this summer. I feel like having this theoretical knowledge will also help me as I get to know more of the field I work in.</li>
                    
                    <li>Along with the previous note, become more comfortable reading technical papers. The previous summer I felt like I read papers by very carefully reading through each paragraph, looking up terms and facts that I wasn't familiar with as I went, scribbling down tonnes of note. Sure, I came out of the process knowing more I did at the beginning, but it's not nearly as efficient as I want to be! </li>
                    
                    <li>Spend more time in the lab and get to know more researchers! It would be nice to have a community of people to do work with.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On a different note, this week I learned how to soldier! Pictured below are a bunch of microbugs that I helped prepare. They're little robots that run towards the nearest source of light. All I did was soldier on the transistors for the kids since they frequently mess up that step. It's something small, but it was oddly refreshing working with something actually <em>tangible</em>!
